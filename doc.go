// Package mdreminder detects whether urls in projects'
// instructions(e.g. *.md files) are valid.
//
// You can view details on Github: https://github.com/AaronWharton/mdreminder
//
// It is intended to automatically find the invalid links in files and
// inform user to correct the url. When you migrate your project, the
// urls seem not to work, mdreminder can amend the url in time.
